# Operator Guide

:::note
This guide is a work in progress.
:::

This section will cover everything an operator (teacher, session facilitator) needs to know to run a SIMPLE session: launching simulations from the web UI, managing headsets, monitoring the session, and handling common issues.

Topics to be covered:
- Starting and stopping simulations from the web interface
- Connecting and managing VR headsets
- Reading the monitor view and player status indicators
- Handling disconnections and reconnections during a session
- Ending a session cleanly
