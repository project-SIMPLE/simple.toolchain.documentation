This section will cover everything a Virtual Universe (VU) creator needs to know to integrate their simulation into the SIMPLE platform.

Topics to be covered:
- Setting up the `settings.json` configuration file (see [Understanding the settings.json file](../../Virtual-Universes/settings.md))
- Using the [VU documentation template](../../Virtual-Universes/VU.template.md) to document your VU
- Structuring your GAMA model for use with SIMPLE
- Providing splashscreen assets and player-facing resources
- Testing and validating your VU on the platform
